Data Replication 
While replicating the data and using the date field always keep in thw mind that date is in the format YYYY-MM-DD

When we create table from BAS unless and until it is not delete from the BAS we will not able to use drop command in Data Explorer

If you want to select multiple fields in sequence  we will use Shift + click it will select multiple fields in single go
